The long-term goal is that we'll be building a like-for-like environment for UAT and Production later but right now this is just for Development… Setting up for success.</p>\n<p>The development team are after a new SQL PaaS database. They're security conscious have heard SQL PaaS in Azure can be protected so it can only be accessed on internal IP ranges on a virtual network. They're excited by this and are keen to explore this in development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instructions\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#instructions\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Instructions</h2>\n<p>Using your Azure Subscription, deploy the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need a new Azure Resource Group created.</li>\n<li>Deploy in the new Resource Group a vNet (a /24 CIDR sized subnet) and a SQL PaaS Database.</li>\n<li>We want the SQL PaaS database to be connected by the vNet only and not accessible via the internet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"infrastructure-as-code\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#infrastructure-as-code\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Infrastructure as Code</h3>\n<p>The development team colleagues have reached out and shared their two (2) ARM Templates with you.

The company is very security conscious it's imperative that the DynamoDB can only be accessed by a new VPC. Eventually the plan is for the VPC to connect back to on-premises but for right now the developers just want to know the DynamoDB can be accessed only by internal IP ranges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instructions-1\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#instructions-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Instructions</h2>\n<p>Using your AWS Account, deploy the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A VPC (a /24 CIDR sized VPC is fine)</li>\n<li>A DynamoDB table. The table name is whatever you want to call it.</li>\n<li>Configuration of the DynamoDB table endpoint so it can be accessed only by the VPC.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"infrastructure-as-code-1\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#infrastructure-as-code-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Infrastructure as Code</h3>\n<p>The development team colleagues have reached out and shared their two (2) CloudFormation Templates with you.
